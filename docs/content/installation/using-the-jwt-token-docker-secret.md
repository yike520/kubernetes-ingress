This document explains how to use the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller image from the F5 Docker registry in your Kubernetes cluster by using your NGINX Ingress Controller subscription JWT token. **Please note that an NGINX Plus subscription certificate and key will not work with the F5 Docker registry.** You can also get the image using alternative methods:

* You can use Docker to pull an Ingress Controller image with NGINX Plus and push it to your private registry by following the [Pulling the Ingress Controller Image]({{< relref "/installation/pulling-ingress-controller-image.md" >}}) documentation.
* Please see the [information on how to build an Ingress Controller image]({{< relref "/installation/building-ingress-controller-image.md" >}}) using the source code from this repository and your NGINX Plus subscription certificate and key.
* Note that for NGINX Ingress Controller based on NGINX OSS, we provide the image through [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress/).

## Prerequisites

* For NGINX Ingress Controller, you must have the NGINX Ingress Controller subscription -- download the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller (per instance) JWT access token from [MyF5](https://my.f5.com).
* To list the available image tags using the Docker registry API, you will also need to download the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller (per instance) certificate (`nginx-repo.crt`) and the key (`nginx-repo.key`) from [MyF5](https://my.f5.com).

## Using the JWT token in a Docker Config Secret

1. Create a `docker-registry` secret on the cluster using the JWT token as the username and `none` for password (password is unused).  The name of the docker server is `private-registry.nginx.com`. Optionally namespace the secret.

	```
    kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=private-registry.nginx.com --docker-username=<JWT Token> --docker-password=none [-n nginx-ingress]
    ```

2. Confirm the details of the created secret by running:

	```bash
    kubectl get secret regcred --output=yaml
    ```

3. You can now add this secret to a deployment spec or to a service account to apply to all deployments for a given SA spec. See the [Create a Pod that uses your Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-pod-that-uses-your-secret) and [Add ImagePullSecrets to a service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#add-imagepullsecrets-to-a-service-account) documentation for more details.

4. Update the deployment spec with the chosen image path. Choose the image from the [available images]({{< relref "/technical-specifications.md#images-with-nginx-plus" >}}).

5. You can use the certificate and key from the MyF5 portal and the Docker registry API to list the available image tags for the repositories, e.g.:
   ```
   $ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
   {
    "name": "nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress",
    "tags": [
        "2.4.0-alpine",
        "2.4.0-ubi",
        "2.4.0"
    ]
    }

   $ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
   {
    "name": "nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress",
    "tags": [
        "2.4.0-ubi",
        "2.4.0"
    ]
    }

   $ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
   {
    "name": "nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress",
    "tags": [
        "2.4.0-ubi",
        "2.4.0"
    ]
    }
   ```
